|Ficool2| To my knowledge all icons in the editor-ficool folder were created by them (or A Boojum Snark). I painstakingly copy/pasted each icon from their tf2 ultimate .FGD (from tf2maps.net) over to the Mapbase .FGD. I edited and reused a few of their icons as well.| https://ficool2.github.io/HammerPlusPlus-Website/ |
|Blixibon | I edited and reused a few of their Mapbase specific icons such as logic_script and damage_info for example. | https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013 |
|Ellent| I combined my modified entropy zero 2 .FGD's with theirs for twice the improvements. | https://steamcommunity.com/id/koishis_mr_hat |
| TeamSpen210 | Some icon entity's like point_entity_finder are by them (i asked nicely), and I based some like point_advanced_finder (similar Mapbase entity) off of them as well. | https://github.com/TeamSpen210 |
| A Boojum Snark | inspiration for ficool's fgd which in turn inspired mine. its all your fault ðŸ˜‚ | https://tf2maps.net/downloads/ultimate-mapping-resource-pack.510/ |
| The Spud Lord | When A Boojum Snark and Ficool disappeared, he stepped up. inspiration and some typo fixes for this fgd. | https://tf2maps.net/threads/an-fgd-fit-for-a-lord.41812/ |
| Brokkhouse | And when spud  lord fell, the Brokkhouse rose to take the team fortress 2 .fgd throne. A valuable reference point using their inherited .FGD knowledge. | https://tf2maps.net/downloads/an-fgd-fit-for-a-lord-brokk-edition.15924/ |
| MrFunReal | Some sort of gooner that also makes .fgd's. very cool and relatable. some clever ideas taken from their l4d2 fgds | https://steamcommunity.com/id/funreal (nsfw) |
| Pinsplash | The obscure source engine knowledge king. You bow to no one. Used many of their descriptions and found many hidden gems of knowledge long forgotten. | https://github.com/Pinsplash/SEFGD |
| Vizzy | Hey thas me. I wrote this. And I made the bad icons. I'm thanking myself. I also hate myself. | https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/User:Vizzys |
