To my knowledge all icons in the editor-ficool folder were created by them (or A Boojum Snark). I painstakingly copy/pasted each icon from their tf2 ultimate .FGD (from tf2maps.net) over to the Mapbase .FGD 
I edited and reused a few of their icons as well.

I edited and reused a few of their Mapbase specific icons such as logic_script and damage_info for example.

I combined my modified entropy zero 2 .FGD's with theirs for twice the improvements.

Some icon entity's like point_entity_finder are by them, and I based the icon point_advanced_finder (similar Mapbase entity) off of it as well.

Valuable reference point using their .FGD knowledge and fixes.

Extremely valuable reference point, used many of their descriptions and found many hidden gems of knowledge long forgotten.

I wrote this. And I made the bad icons. I'm thanking myself.
