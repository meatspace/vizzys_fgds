To my knowledge all icons in the editor-ficool folder were created by them. I painstakingly copy/pasted each icon from their tf2 ultimate .fgd (downloaded from tf2maps.net) over to the Mapbase .fgd 
I edited and reused a few of their icons as well.

Blixibon:

I edited and reused a few of their Mapbase specific icons such as logic_script and damage_info for example.

I combined my modified entropy zero 2 .FGD's with theirs for twice the improvements.

TeamSpen210:

Some icon entity's like point_entity_finder are by them, and I based the icon point_advanced_finder (a similar Mapbase entity) off of it as well.

I wrote this. And I made the bad icons. I'm thanking myself.
